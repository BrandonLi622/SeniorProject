                                             output is not correct
                                             Resolved: Problem was that the server assignments
                                             did not get cleared after reassigning the active
                                             servers in the view change (error has not been
                                             reproduced after fix)
2        2/10/14      Resolved  2/10/14      In Mockup.py view_num kept increasing but
                                             all_views has to take view_num % len(all_views), which
                                             it didn't before
