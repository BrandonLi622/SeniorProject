Extending Dissent to tolerate server failures

Use as:
./runProtocol {numServers} {numClients} {slotLength}

This version of the protocol uses fixed length messages

2/3 majority needed for a view change (servers can propose a view change from the UI, currently)

A view is defined as 2/3 of the servers

In each view (which each node (client or server) calculates on the fly, each client is matched with a specific server

From the UI (client): type in messages of the specified length or just hit enter to randomly generate a message
From the UI (server): propose view changes

Right now all of the clients must send a message before the round terminates
